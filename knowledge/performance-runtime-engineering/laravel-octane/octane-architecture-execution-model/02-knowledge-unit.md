# Executive Summary

Laravel Octane boots the application **once** at worker start, then handles thousands of requests within the same process. This eliminates the 10-40ms framework bootstrap cost (service container construction, config loading, provider registration, route registration) that every PHP-FPM request pays. Octane operates as a **bridge** between Laravel and an underlying application server (RoadRunner, Swoole, FrankenPHP), abstracting the runtime selection via a unified API.

---

# Core Concepts

- **Boot sequence**: `artisan octane:start` → worker starts → bootstrap (kernel boot, providers register, routes load) → loop: wait for request → dispatch → response → cleanup.
- **Per-request dispatch**: Octane creates a fresh Laravel application instance per request using `Illuminate\Foundation\Application` cloned from the booted template. Service providers that boot once per worker retain state; per-request providers run fresh.
- **Sandbox pattern**: Octane uses a sandbox container. Application-level services are cloned per request; framework-level services (config, events, logging) are shared.
- **Driver abstraction**: Octane\Octane::driver() returns the active runtime driver. All runtime-specific code is behind this interface.

---

# Performance Considerations

- Benchmark ranges: 2.5-3.1x (mixed workloads) to 15-20x (API workloads) over PHP-FPM
- The largest gain comes from API endpoints with <50ms response times
- For endpoints with >500ms I/O wait, the relative gain is 20-40% (bootstrap was proportionally smaller)

---

# Common Mistakes

**Assuming Octane is a drop-in replacement**: Octane requires service provider auditing, static property management, and state leak prevention. Many packages require modification.

## Mental Models

**Power plant model**: PHP-FPM is starting up and shutting down a generator for every kilowatt produced. Octane is a power plant that keeps the turbine spinning â€” fuel (bootstrap) is burned once, and the spinning turbine handles variable load. Sandbox containers are separate circuit breakers that contain faults without taking down the whole grid.

---

## Internal Mechanics

Octane's bootstrap occurs once per worker during rtisan octane:start. The worker's boot sequence: Illuminate\Foundation\Application constructed â†’ service providers registered â†’ providers booted â†’ routes/facades registered â†’ event loop begins. Per-request handling creates a sandbox by cloning the application instance. Request-specific services (database connections, session, auth) are fresh per-request while config, events, and logging singletons are shared. Octane intercepts framework shutdown by replacing $app->terminate() calls with sandbox reset logic. State leaks are detected by tracking static property modifications via a callback registered in zend_execute_data.

---

## Patterns

**Safe migration pattern**: 1) Audit all service providers for state leaks, 2) Add Octane::booted() callbacks for per-worker initialization, 3) Replace static property usage with pp()->instance() bindings, 4) Test with php artisan octane:status to verify worker health, 5) Deploy to 10% of servers first, compare error rates for 24 hours.

## Architectural Decisions

- **RoadRunner vs Swoole vs FrankenPHP as Octane driver**: RoadRunner offers the simplest worker model (process-per-worker) and best isolation. Swoole provides coroutine-based concurrency for I/O-bound workloads. FrankenPHP is easiest to deploy (single binary). The driver choice affects maximum concurrency, memory footprint, and debugging complexity.
- **Service provider strategy**: Deferring non-essential providers to per-request execution reduces worker memory. Boot essential providers once, defer expensive ones. Audit all providers for request-scoped singletons.

## Tradeoffs

| Tradeoff | Benefit | Cost |
|----------|---------|------|
| Octane vs FPM | 2-20x throughput improvement | State management, package compatibility |
| RoadRunner driver | Process isolation, simple | Higher per-worker memory |
| Swoole driver | Coroutine concurrency, low memory | Non-blocking requirement, complex debugging |
| FrankenPHP driver | Single binary, zero config | Newer, smaller ecosystem |

---

## Production Considerations

- **Health checks**: Configure Octane health endpoint (/octane/health). Monitor via load balancer. Alert if health check fails on any worker.
- **Graceful reload**: php artisan octane:reload â€” reloads workers without dropping requests. Run after every deploy.
- **State leak detection**: Monitor worker RSS growth. Increase >10% per hour indicates state leak. Set octane:watch during development to detect leaks.
- **Connection pooling**: Configure database and Redis connection limits to match worker count. Each worker maintains persistent connections.

---

## Failure Modes

- **Memory leak in long-running worker**: Service provider registers listeners on each request without cleanup. Symptom: Worker RSS grows by 1-5MB per request until OOM. Mitigation: Audit providers, use Octane::booted() for one-time registration, monitor RSS.
- **Stale singleton state**: Singleton holds request-scoped data that leaks to next request. Symptom: User A sees User B's data. Mitigation: Use sandbox pattern, clone stateful services, never store request data in singletons.
- **Deadlock in connection pool**: All database connections checked out, request waits forever. Symptom: Workers stuck, no requests complete. Mitigation: Set connection pool timeout, monitor pool utilization, ensure connections returned after request.

---

## Ecosystem Usage

- **Laravel Octane**: The primary Octane user base. Over 1M installs on Packagist. Supported by Laravel Forge, Laravel Cloud, and Vapor. Used in production by major Laravel agencies.
- **RoadRunner**: Spiral Framework's application server. Over 500 GitHub stars for Octane integration. Mature, well-documented, PHP 8.4 compatible.
- **FrankenPHP**: Newest runtime. Growing rapidly with Docker official image, K8s Helm chart, and Laravel-specific documentation. 6K+ GitHub stars.
- **Swoole**: Most mature coroutine-based PHP runtime. Used in China extensively (WeChat, Meituan). PHP 8.x support lags slightly behind RoadRunner and FrankenPHP.

## Research Notes

- Laravel Octane's sandbox model: Research on per-request Application cloning overhead shows 0.5-2ms per request â€” negligible compared to the 10-40ms bootstrap it replaces.
- State leak prevention: Static analysis tools (Larastan, PHPStan) now include rules for detecting Octane-unsafe static property usage. Community packages like stan-blade/laravel-octane-analyzer provide automated audits.
- Performance cliff research: Octane throughput drops 40-60% when memory pressure triggers swap. Proper max_children calculation is critical for maintaining gains.
- FrankenPHP + Octane: Initial benchmarks show 5-10% overhead over RoadRunner due to CGO boundary crossing in PHP request handling. Expected to narrow in future releases.

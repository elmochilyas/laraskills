# Executive Summary

Profiling tools capture **actual SQL queries** with their execution time, parameter values, and stack traces. This reveals which queries are slow, where they're called from, and how many times they execute. The combination of query time + call count reveals the real cost: a 5ms query called 200 times (N+1) costs 1000ms — far more than a single 200ms query.

---

# Core Concepts

- **SQL capture**: Blackfire and Tideways automatically capture database queries with duration, row count, and parameter values. Xdebug requires explicit `pdo/msqli` tracing extension.
- **Query cost analysis**: Total query cost = sum(execution_time × call_count) for each unique query. Grouped by query fingerprint (normalized query text without parameters).
- **N+1 detection**: Same query fingerprint with different parameters, executed many times from the same stack trace. Blackfire highlights N+1 queries automatically in the dashboard.
- **Slow query log cross-reference**: Compare profiling tool's slow queries with MySQL's slow query log. Not all slow queries appear in the log (threshold-based) but all are visible in profiles.

---

# Patterns

**Query optimization priority**: 1) N+1 queries (high call count, often invisible in slow query log), 2) Large table scans (high row count, high execution time), 3) Missing index queries (consistent moderate time), 4) Temp table / filesort queries.

---

# Common Mistakes

**Fixing slow queries without profiling**: The database slow query log shows only queries over a threshold. For example, a 5ms query called 100 times = 500ms. The slow query log misses it. Always profile to see the full query cost picture.

---

# Performance Considerations

- Xdebug adds 50-200% overhead; use for staging only. Blackfire adds 10-25% overhead.
- SPX, Tideways add 1-5% overhead; suitable for production with sampling rate and IP restrictions
- Flame graph width = inclusive time, red = CPU-bound, blue = I/O-bound; look for plateaus
- eBPF profiling: kernel-level with <1% overhead; captures PHP + system calls; PHP 8.1+ required
- Production strategy: sample 1% of requests; disable during peak hours; correlate with slow logs

## Mental Models

**Camera model**: Profiling is taking slow-motion video of your code. Flame graphs are the video frames â€” width shows how long each actor (function) is on screen. Inclusive time is the actor's total screen time including supporting cast. Exclusive time is the actor's solo performance. Comparing p50 to p95 flame graphs is watching the video at different playback speeds.

## Internal Mechanics

Sampling profilers (Xdebug, Tideways, Blackfire) register a timer signal handler (SIGPROF, typically at 49-100 Hz) that interrupts PHP execution and records the current execute_data stack trace via zend_execute_data->prev_execute_data chain. Each sample captures function name, file, line, and inclusive/exclusive time markers. The samples are aggregated into a call graph where node weight = sample count. Xdebug 3 uses a request-level profiler (xdebug.mode=profile) that writes cachegrind-format files. eBPF profiling attaches kprobes to Zend VM dispatch functions (execute_ex, zend_call_function) from kernel space, requiring zero PHP configuration.

## Patterns

**Tiered profiling workflow**: 1) Production monitoring â†’ identify slow endpoints via APM, 2) Flame graph generation â†’ identify wide frames (time sinks), 3) Call graph analysis â†’ follow the hot path, 4) Source-level profiling â†’ inspect specific functions, 5) Fix â†’ deploy â†’ verify with same flame graph comparison.

## Architectural Decisions

- **Sampling vs Instrumentation**: Sampling profilers (Xdebug, Tideways, eBPF) have low overhead (1-3%) and are safe for production but provide statistical approximation. Instrumented profilers (Blackfire, Xdebug trace mode) provide exact measurements but have 10-30% overhead â€” development/staging only.
- **Production vs Staging profiling**: Profile in production for authentic results but with sampling only. Use heavier instrumentation in staging with production-like traffic. The production profile is the ground truth â€” always validate staging findings against production.

## Tradeoffs

| Tradeoff | Benefit | Cost |
|----------|---------|------|
| Xdebug (sampling) | Low overhead, free | ~3-5% CPU overhead, cachegrind files |
| Blackfire | Production-safe, rich UI | Paid tier, proprietary format |
| Tideways | Continuous monitoring | Subscription cost, integration effort |
| eBPF | Zero PHP overhead, no configuration | Linux-only, requires kernel support |

---

## Production Considerations

- **Production profiling safety**: Use sampling profilers (1-3% overhead) in production. Never use instrumentation profilers on live traffic. eBPF is ideal for production-zero overhead.
- **Alert-driven profiling**: Trigger flame graph capture automatically when latency crosses threshold. Store profiles for post-mortem analysis.
- **Profiling cadence**: Continuous profiling (Tideways/Blackfire) for baseline. On-demand deep profiling (Xdebug) for specific investigations.
- **Data retention**: Store flame graphs for 30 days minimum. Correlate with deploy events to identify performance regressions.

---

## Failure Modes

- **Observer effect**: Profiling overhead alters application behavior. Symptom: Production profiling with heavy tools shows different performance profile than normal. Mitigation: Use low-overhead (<3%) profilers for production. Accept statistical approximation.
- **Profiling bias**: Timing signals in sampling profilers correlate with application intervals. Symptom: Under- or over-representation of certain code paths. Mitigation: Use random sampling intervals, vary sampling frequency.
- **Flame graph misinterpretation**: Wide bottom frames misidentified as bottlenecks. Symptom: Optimizing the wrong function. Mitigation: Always check whether width is self-time or inclusive. Wide bottom frame with many children = potentially architectural.

## Ecosystem Usage

- **Tideways**: Production profiling SaaS. Low overhead (1-3%). Continuous profiling with monitoring dashboard. PHP extension + API. Ideal for ongoing performance monitoring.
- **Blackfire**: Profiling and testing platform by Symfony. Triggered profiling (via browser extension or CLI). APM features in higher tiers. Rich comparison between profile runs.
- **Xdebug**: Open-source step debugger and profiler. Profiling mode generates cachegrind files. View with KCacheGrind, QCacheGrind, or WebGrind. Best for development profiling.
- **eBPF**: Linux kernel tracing. PHP profiling via uprobe attach to Zend VM functions. Tools like Pixie, Parca, and bpftrace. Zero PHP overhead â€” best for production.

## Research Notes

- eBPF for PHP profiling: Active research area. Tools like Parca, Pixie, and bpftrace enable kernel-level profiling without PHP extension overhead. Current limitations: function name resolution in JIT-compiled code, coroutine-aware stack unwinding.
- Continuous profiling: Industry trend toward always-on profiling (instead of triggered). Google's OpenProfiling and Polar Signals show that continuous profiles catch regressions missed by traditional monitoring.
- Flame graph evolution: Brendan Gregg's original flame graphs now include icicle graphs (inverted), flame charts (time-series), and differential flame graphs (before/after comparison).

# Executive Summary

**SPX** (Simple Profiling eXtension) is a self-hosted, open-source PHP profiler with a modern web UI. It collects timing and memory metrics with low overhead (<5%), stores them locally, and provides a browser-based dashboard for exploring profiles. Ideal for private/internal environments where sending data to external cloud services (Blackfire/Tideways) is restricted.

---

# Core Concepts

- **Installation**: `pecl install spx` or compile from source. PHP extension `spx.so`. Configure via `php.ini`: `spx.http_enabled=1`, `spx.http_key=secret-key`, `spx.data_dir=/tmp/spx`.
- **Triggering**: Add `?SPX_KEY=secret-key&SPX_PROFILE=1` to any URL. Or use HTTP header `X-SPX-Profile: 1`. Profile collected for that request only.
- **Web UI**: Navigate to `http://app/SPX?SPX_KEY=secret-key`. Dashboard shows: call tree (inclusive/exclusive time), flame graph, flat profile, memory timeline, and request metadata.
- **Data storage**: Profiles stored as flat files in `spx.data_dir`. Configurable retention. No external service needed.

---

# Performance Considerations

- Overhead: <5% when profiling, 0% when not profiling (no active extension overhead)
- Disk usage: ~10-50KB per profile. At 1000 profiles/day = ~10-50MB/day. Manage retention accordingly.
- Security: Always set `spx.http_key` and protect with firewall (localhost-only access). Never expose in production without authentication.

---

# Common Mistakes

**SPX exposed without HTTP key**: Anyone can trigger profiling by adding `SPX_PROFILE=1` parameter. This enables profiling on every request with the parameter, degrading performance. Always set `spx.http_key`.

## Mental Models

**Camera model**: Profiling is taking slow-motion video of your code. Flame graphs are the video frames â€” width shows how long each actor (function) is on screen. Inclusive time is the actor's total screen time including supporting cast. Exclusive time is the actor's solo performance. Comparing p50 to p95 flame graphs is watching the video at different playback speeds.

## Internal Mechanics

Sampling profilers (Xdebug, Tideways, Blackfire) register a timer signal handler (SIGPROF, typically at 49-100 Hz) that interrupts PHP execution and records the current execute_data stack trace via zend_execute_data->prev_execute_data chain. Each sample captures function name, file, line, and inclusive/exclusive time markers. The samples are aggregated into a call graph where node weight = sample count. Xdebug 3 uses a request-level profiler (xdebug.mode=profile) that writes cachegrind-format files. eBPF profiling attaches kprobes to Zend VM dispatch functions (execute_ex, zend_call_function) from kernel space, requiring zero PHP configuration.

## Patterns

**Tiered profiling workflow**: 1) Production monitoring â†’ identify slow endpoints via APM, 2) Flame graph generation â†’ identify wide frames (time sinks), 3) Call graph analysis â†’ follow the hot path, 4) Source-level profiling â†’ inspect specific functions, 5) Fix â†’ deploy â†’ verify with same flame graph comparison.

## Architectural Decisions

- **Sampling vs Instrumentation**: Sampling profilers (Xdebug, Tideways, eBPF) have low overhead (1-3%) and are safe for production but provide statistical approximation. Instrumented profilers (Blackfire, Xdebug trace mode) provide exact measurements but have 10-30% overhead â€” development/staging only.
- **Production vs Staging profiling**: Profile in production for authentic results but with sampling only. Use heavier instrumentation in staging with production-like traffic. The production profile is the ground truth â€” always validate staging findings against production.

## Tradeoffs

| Tradeoff | Benefit | Cost |
|----------|---------|------|
| Xdebug (sampling) | Low overhead, free | ~3-5% CPU overhead, cachegrind files |
| Blackfire | Production-safe, rich UI | Paid tier, proprietary format |
| Tideways | Continuous monitoring | Subscription cost, integration effort |
| eBPF | Zero PHP overhead, no configuration | Linux-only, requires kernel support |

---

## Production Considerations

- **Production profiling safety**: Use sampling profilers (1-3% overhead) in production. Never use instrumentation profilers on live traffic. eBPF is ideal for production-zero overhead.
- **Alert-driven profiling**: Trigger flame graph capture automatically when latency crosses threshold. Store profiles for post-mortem analysis.
- **Profiling cadence**: Continuous profiling (Tideways/Blackfire) for baseline. On-demand deep profiling (Xdebug) for specific investigations.
- **Data retention**: Store flame graphs for 30 days minimum. Correlate with deploy events to identify performance regressions.

---

## Failure Modes

- **Observer effect**: Profiling overhead alters application behavior. Symptom: Production profiling with heavy tools shows different performance profile than normal. Mitigation: Use low-overhead (<3%) profilers for production. Accept statistical approximation.
- **Profiling bias**: Timing signals in sampling profilers correlate with application intervals. Symptom: Under- or over-representation of certain code paths. Mitigation: Use random sampling intervals, vary sampling frequency.
- **Flame graph misinterpretation**: Wide bottom frames misidentified as bottlenecks. Symptom: Optimizing the wrong function. Mitigation: Always check whether width is self-time or inclusive. Wide bottom frame with many children = potentially architectural.

## Ecosystem Usage

- **Tideways**: Production profiling SaaS. Low overhead (1-3%). Continuous profiling with monitoring dashboard. PHP extension + API. Ideal for ongoing performance monitoring.
- **Blackfire**: Profiling and testing platform by Symfony. Triggered profiling (via browser extension or CLI). APM features in higher tiers. Rich comparison between profile runs.
- **Xdebug**: Open-source step debugger and profiler. Profiling mode generates cachegrind files. View with KCacheGrind, QCacheGrind, or WebGrind. Best for development profiling.
- **eBPF**: Linux kernel tracing. PHP profiling via uprobe attach to Zend VM functions. Tools like Pixie, Parca, and bpftrace. Zero PHP overhead â€” best for production.

## Research Notes

- eBPF for PHP profiling: Active research area. Tools like Parca, Pixie, and bpftrace enable kernel-level profiling without PHP extension overhead. Current limitations: function name resolution in JIT-compiled code, coroutine-aware stack unwinding.
- Continuous profiling: Industry trend toward always-on profiling (instead of triggered). Google's OpenProfiling and Polar Signals show that continuous profiles catch regressions missed by traditional monitoring.
- Flame graph evolution: Brendan Gregg's original flame graphs now include icicle graphs (inverted), flame charts (time-series), and differential flame graphs (before/after comparison).

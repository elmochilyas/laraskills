# Overview

Microservices decomposition threshold identifies when a monolith should be split into services. The industry consensus (2024-2026) strongly favors "monolith first, extract later" â€” premature microservices are a leading source of architectural failure. Threshold assessment evaluates organizational (team size, Conway's Law), technical (deployment frequency, scaling requirements), and domain (bounded context stability) factors. Most applications never need microservices; those that do should extract incrementally.

# Core Concepts
This knowledge unit addresses key concerns related to Microservices decomposition threshold assessment in the context of backend architecture and design for PHP/Laravel applications.


---

# When To Use
- When the architecture requires separation of concerns and clear boundaries
- When the system has clear variation points that benefit from encapsulation
- When independent testability of components is a priority


---

# When NOT To Use
- When the abstraction adds complexity without clear benefit
- When the system is simple CRUD with no variation points
- When team is not familiar with the pattern


---

# Best Practices

1. **Start Simple, Refactor Later**
   WHY: Premature abstraction is a primary source of architectural debt. Apply patterns only when concrete variation points emerge, not from theoretical future needs. The YAGNI principle applies strongly to architecture.

2. **Enforce Boundaries via Automation**
   WHY: Manual discipline degrades over time, especially as teams grow and turnover occurs. Automated checks (PHPStan rules, Deptrac) encode architecture into executable tests that run in CI, catching violations before they merge.

3. **Prefer Composition Over Inheritance**
   WHY: Composition provides runtime flexibility, reduces coupling to base class hierarchies, and avoids the fragile base class problem. Each component can be tested independently and substituted without affecting siblings.

4. **Keep the Domain Layer Framework-Agnostic**
   WHY: Framework coupling in domain logic makes upgrades painful and reduces portability. The domain should depend on interfaces defined by the application, not on framework base classes.

5. **Document Architecture Decisions**
   WHY: ADRs capture the context, alternatives, and rationale behind architectural choices. This prevents repeated debates, helps onboarding, and provides historical traceability for why the architecture is the way it is.

6. **Measure Coupling and Cohesion**
   WHY: Objective metrics (afferent/efferent coupling, instability, abstractness) provide early warning of architectural decay. Trending these metrics over time reveals when refactoring is needed before the code becomes unmanageable.

7. **Design for Change Containment**
   WHY: The best architectures make the most common changes easy and the most dangerous changes difficult. Organize code so that business rule changes affect only the domain layer, infrastructure changes affect only the adapter layer, etc.

# Architecture Guidelines

## Layer Organization

- Domain core: entities, value objects, domain services, domain events, repository interfaces
- Application: use cases, DTOs, command/query handlers, application services
- Infrastructure: repository implementations, HTTP clients, mail drivers, queue adapters
- UI/Framework: controllers, CLI commands, scheduled tasks, middleware

## Dependency Rule

Dependencies must point inward: Infrastructure → Application → Domain. The domain layer must have zero dependencies on frameworks or infrastructure.

## Boundary Enforcement

- Use PHPStan custom rules to prevent layer violations
- Use Deptrac for module-level dependency analysis
- Use PHPArkitect for architecture-level assertions
- Run these checks in CI, not just locally

## Communication Patterns

- Favor async communication (events, queues) across module/service boundaries
- Use sync only within the same module or when transactional consistency is required
- Document all cross-boundary communication contracts

---

# Performance Considerations

- **Overhead of abstraction**: Each layer of indirection adds method call overhead. In hot paths, minimize layer crossings.
- **Memory footprint**: Each architectural component (service, repository, interface) adds object graph size. Use lazy resolution where possible.
- **Initialization cost**: First-resolution overhead for container-managed components. Cache aggressively for production.
- **Serialization cost**: Cross-boundary communication requires serialization. Choose efficient formats (JSON vs binary) based on throughput needs.
- **Connection pooling**: Services communicating externally should reuse connections to avoid TCP handshake overhead.
- **Profiling**: Always measure before optimizing. Use Laravel Debugbar, Telescope, or Xdebug to identify real bottlenecks.

# Security Considerations

- **Input validation at boundaries**: Validate all data entering the domain layer, regardless of source (HTTP, queue, CLI)
- **Output sanitization**: Sanitize data leaving the domain for the presentation layer
- **Authentication/Authorization gates**: Apply security checks at architectural boundaries, not inside domain logic
- **Dependency isolation**: Anti-corruption layers prevent security vulnerabilities in third-party code from propagating
- **Event data leakage**: Ensure domain events don't expose sensitive data to unauthorized consumers
- **Command validation**: Validate commands before dispatch to prevent injection attacks
- **Rate limiting at entry points**: Apply throttling at architectural entry points (controllers, queue workers)

# Anti-Patterns

- **Golden Hammer**: Applying the same architectural pattern to every problem regardless of context
- **Premature Distribution**: Decomposing into services before understanding domain boundaries
- **Anemic Domain Model**: Domain objects with no behavior, only getters/setters
- **Big Ball of Mud**: No coherent architecture, arbitrary dependencies
- **Lava Flow**: Dead code and abandoned experiments left in the codebase
- **Architecture by Implication**: Assuming architecture exists without explicit documentation or enforcement
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Over-analyzing architectural options without making decisions
- **Death Star**: Over-centralized architecture that creates a single point of failure
- **Distributed Monolith**: Microservices that are tightly coupled, requiring coordinated deployments

# AI Agent Notes

When assisting with architecture decisions related to Microservices decomposition threshold assessment:

1. **Always assess context first** - Understand the application's scale, team size, and business domain before recommending architectural patterns
2. **Prefer incremental improvement** - Recommend refactoring toward better architecture rather than rewrites
3. **Highlight tradeoffs** - Every architectural decision involves tradeoffs; present both benefits and costs
4. **Reference concrete patterns** - Point to specific design patterns with code examples
5. **Consider team maturity** - Advanced patterns require team understanding and buy-in
6. **Enforce with automation** - Recommend automated architectural enforcement (PHPStan rules, CI checks)
7. **Document decisions** - Suggest ADR creation for significant architectural decisions
8. **Avoid over-engineering** - Be conservative about adding abstraction layers; YAGNI applies strongly

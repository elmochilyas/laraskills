# Overview

State allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change its class. In Laravel, state machines are commonly implemented for order workflows (pending â†’ confirmed â†’ shipped â†’ delivered), approval processes, and subscription lifecycles. The pattern eliminates complex switch/if-else chains on state values by delegating state-dependent behavior to separate state objects.

# Core Concepts
This knowledge unit addresses key concerns related to State pattern in PHP/Laravel context in the context of backend architecture and design for PHP/Laravel applications.


---

# When To Use
- When the architecture requires separation of concerns and clear boundaries
- When the system has clear variation points that benefit from encapsulation
- When independent testability of components is a priority


---

# When NOT To Use
- Avoid for: simple boolean flags â€” if/else or ternary is clearer
- Avoid for: states that don't affect behavior (just status labels)


---

# Best Practices

1. **Start Simple, Refactor Later**
   WHY: Premature abstraction is a primary source of architectural debt. Apply patterns only when concrete variation points emerge, not from theoretical future needs. The YAGNI principle applies strongly to architecture.

2. **Enforce Boundaries via Automation**
   WHY: Manual discipline degrades over time, especially as teams grow and turnover occurs. Automated checks (PHPStan rules, Deptrac) encode architecture into executable tests that run in CI, catching violations before they merge.

3. **Prefer Composition Over Inheritance**
   WHY: Composition provides runtime flexibility, reduces coupling to base class hierarchies, and avoids the fragile base class problem. Each component can be tested independently and substituted without affecting siblings.

4. **Keep the Domain Layer Framework-Agnostic**
   WHY: Framework coupling in domain logic makes upgrades painful and reduces portability. The domain should depend on interfaces defined by the application, not on framework base classes.

5. **Document Architecture Decisions**
   WHY: ADRs capture the context, alternatives, and rationale behind architectural choices. This prevents repeated debates, helps onboarding, and provides historical traceability for why the architecture is the way it is.

6. **Measure Coupling and Cohesion**
   WHY: Objective metrics (afferent/efferent coupling, instability, abstractness) provide early warning of architectural decay. Trending these metrics over time reveals when refactoring is needed before the code becomes unmanageable.

7. **Design for Change Containment**
   WHY: The best architectures make the most common changes easy and the most dangerous changes difficult. Organize code so that business rule changes affect only the domain layer, infrastructure changes affect only the adapter layer, etc.

# Architecture Guidelines

## Layer Organization

- Domain core: entities, value objects, domain services, domain events, repository interfaces
- Application: use cases, DTOs, command/query handlers, application services
- Infrastructure: repository implementations, HTTP clients, mail drivers, queue adapters
- UI/Framework: controllers, CLI commands, scheduled tasks, middleware

## Dependency Rule

Dependencies must point inward: Infrastructure → Application → Domain. The domain layer must have zero dependencies on frameworks or infrastructure.

## Boundary Enforcement

- Use PHPStan custom rules to prevent layer violations
- Use Deptrac for module-level dependency analysis
- Use PHPArkitect for architecture-level assertions
- Run these checks in CI, not just locally

## Communication Patterns

- Favor async communication (events, queues) across module/service boundaries
- Use sync only within the same module or when transactional consistency is required
- Document all cross-boundary communication contracts

---

# Performance Considerations

- State object overhead: one instance per state (can be singleton if stateless)
- Method dispatch through state object: one extra indirection
- State transition: create new state object (cheap)
- Memory: state objects typically lightweight (no DB connections)

---

---

# Security Considerations

- **Input validation at boundaries**: Validate all data entering the domain layer, regardless of source (HTTP, queue, CLI)
- **Output sanitization**: Sanitize data leaving the domain for the presentation layer
- **Authentication/Authorization gates**: Apply security checks at architectural boundaries, not inside domain logic
- **Dependency isolation**: Anti-corruption layers prevent security vulnerabilities in third-party code from propagating
- **Event data leakage**: Ensure domain events don't expose sensitive data to unauthorized consumers
- **Command validation**: Validate commands before dispatch to prevent injection attacks
- **Rate limiting at entry points**: Apply throttling at architectural entry points (controllers, queue workers)

# Common Mistakes
Each entry includes: Description, Cause, Consequence, and Better Approach.
- **Description**: State object holding context reference â†’ tight coupling, GC issues
- **Cause**: Lack of awareness or discipline in applying the pattern correctly
- **Consequence**: Reduced code quality, maintainability issues, or system fragility
- **Better**: Follow established patterns and practices documented in this knowledge unit

- **Description**: Transitions spread across state objects â†’ transition map hard to maintain
- **Cause**: Lack of awareness or discipline in applying the pattern correctly
- **Consequence**: Reduced code quality, maintainability issues, or system fragility
- **Better**: Follow established patterns and practices documented in this knowledge unit

- **Description**: Forgetting to handle invalid transitions â†’ silent no-op (state doesn't change)
- **Cause**: Lack of awareness or discipline in applying the pattern correctly
- **Consequence**: Reduced code quality, maintainability issues, or system fragility
- **Better**: Follow established patterns and practices documented in this knowledge unit

- **Description**: State pattern used for simple boolean switches â†’ overengineering
- **Cause**: Lack of awareness or discipline in applying the pattern correctly
- **Consequence**: Reduced code quality, maintainability issues, or system fragility
- **Better**: Follow established patterns and practices documented in this knowledge unit

- **Description**: State objects with mutable state â†’ shared state object contaminated across contexts
- **Cause**: Lack of awareness or discipline in applying the pattern correctly
- **Consequence**: Reduced code quality, maintainability issues, or system fragility
- **Better**: Follow established patterns and practices documented in this knowledge unit

# Anti-Patterns

- **Golden Hammer**: Applying the same architectural pattern to every problem regardless of context
- **Premature Distribution**: Decomposing into services before understanding domain boundaries
- **Anemic Domain Model**: Domain objects with no behavior, only getters/setters
- **Big Ball of Mud**: No coherent architecture, arbitrary dependencies
- **Lava Flow**: Dead code and abandoned experiments left in the codebase
- **Architecture by Implication**: Assuming architecture exists without explicit documentation or enforcement
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Over-analyzing architectural options without making decisions
- **Death Star**: Over-centralized architecture that creates a single point of failure
- **Distributed Monolith**: Microservices that are tightly coupled, requiring coordinated deployments

# AI Agent Notes

When assisting with architecture decisions related to State pattern in PHP/Laravel context:

1. **Always assess context first** - Understand the application's scale, team size, and business domain before recommending architectural patterns
2. **Prefer incremental improvement** - Recommend refactoring toward better architecture rather than rewrites
3. **Highlight tradeoffs** - Every architectural decision involves tradeoffs; present both benefits and costs
4. **Reference concrete patterns** - Point to specific design patterns with code examples
5. **Consider team maturity** - Advanced patterns require team understanding and buy-in
6. **Enforce with automation** - Recommend automated architectural enforcement (PHPStan rules, CI checks)
7. **Document decisions** - Suggest ADR creation for significant architectural decisions
8. **Avoid over-engineering** - Be conservative about adding abstraction layers; YAGNI applies strongly

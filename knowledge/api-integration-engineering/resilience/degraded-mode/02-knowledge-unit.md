## Executive Summary
Degraded mode is an operational state where the application continues functioning with reduced capabilities when external services are unavailable. It provides partial functionality, cached data, or alternative features while indicating reduced service level.

## Core Concepts
This knowledge unit covers the essential patterns, practices, and implementation details for this topic within the API Integration Engineering domain.

## Mental Models
- **Abstraction Layer**: Think of this as a protective boundary between your application and external systems
- **Defense in Depth**: Combine multiple patterns for robust integration reliability

## Internal Mechanics
Implementation details depend on the specific Laravel packages, Guzzle configuration, and PHP runtime characteristics applicable to this topic.

## Patterns
- Standard implementation patterns as documented in Laravel ecosystem best practices
- Provider-specific adaptations where applicable

## Architectural Decisions
- Choose the right level of abstraction for your use case
- Balance simplicity with robustness based on integration criticality

## Tradeoffs
- Simplicity vs robustness
- Performance vs reliability guarantees

## Performance Considerations
Consider the latency, throughput, and resource implications of your chosen approach.

## Production Considerations
Monitor, alert, and maintain your integration with appropriate operational practices.

## Common Mistakes
Review common pitfalls documented in community sources and provider documentation.

## Failure Modes
Understand how this integration pattern can fail and design appropriate mitigations.

## Ecosystem Usage
